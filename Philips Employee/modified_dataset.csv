Senior Software Engineer,Bengaluru/Bangalore,Full Time,Software Development Department,7 Sep 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,The work culture is chilled out. Employees take their sweet time to work on the project.,"This review is for IBE department and Philips as a whole in India.
1. DO NOT JOIN IF YOU ARE STARTING YOUR CAREER. If you did join the company try to see opportunities outside ASAP.
2. Appraisal do not depend on how you perform. It’s dependent on your manager and the office politics. 1st promotion you get is after 2.5 years and thattoo a mere 12% increase in your basic
3. The environment is such that you would not want to grow; the peers are not the brightest, the management is bad(they are oldies)
4. The worst department to work in is EIS - IBE.
The work is on a proprietary software which translates to 0 yrs of experience in your resume. The colleagues aren’t aware of the newer technologies that are there in the market. Basically they don’t want to work in uncomfortable environment thus the title dinosaurs is apt for them.
Management and leaders in IBE are dumb/incompetent and do not care about your progression in the organisation. 
5. I was there for 3+ years and in all this time I have never seen profits come to the business
6. The Annual incentive part of your salary is never paid in full, maximum you’ll get is 90%.
7. People here know that there job is secure hence the ‘govt job’ mentality is there.
Lastly if you’re joining, negotiate your salary so that you can live the next 2 years in the org and leave.
Now on the facilities:
1. There is no gymnasium of Philips as such. It is a shared room with equipments between NXP and Philips.
2. No free food not even snacks or beverages. You need to buy it using Sodexo card. And the food isn’t that great. Only thing good was the biryani.
3. No cab facility 
4. The company policies regarding employees have gotten worse and worse since new CEO was appointed
5. Team outings were a part of every BU but has stopped since 2019.
Final words - be wise and look for something else....Read More",0

Roles transferred are displayed as analytics but in the end you are just doing mundane job assigned from onshore and no innovative action. In case if something is done on your own and fails, you are in soup. Better go with the tide.
Job security is the worst and you will be terrorized to drop your papers if you fall in wrong side of onshore counterparts.
